These templates are created by Jordan Peacock (AKA Jordan_Greywolf) and Wendy Peacock (AKA Kujaku10) via AtomicStryker's ruins mod.

Updated: 29 Apr 2017

SPECIAL UPDATE NOTE FOR PREVIOUS RUINS USERS CONVERTING FROM 1.10 TO 1.11: Templates from 1.10 will mostly work, except...

* Some entity ids have changed.  (CaveSpider -> cave_spider, EntityHorse -> horse, zombie (isVillager:1) -> zombie_villager, Ozelot -> Ocelot, etc.)

* Some tags that still used numeric ids have finally moved over to using the name ids instead.

* Teblock logic for flower_pots has changed (as "FlowerPot" has been replaced with "flower_pot").

* Custom equipment on a summoned mob will not be equipped unless Count is specified (1 or greater).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To use, you will need Minecraft (version 1.11), plus AtomicStryker's Ruins mod (using the latest version for Minecraft 1.11).

For AtomicStryker's Ruins mod:

To use these templates, put the folders in the following Minecraft installation folder (exact path may vary depending upon your installation):

*\.minecraft\mods\resources\ruins\

If you're asked to merge folders, go ahead.  This will just add the templates to those currently in the affected biomes folders (possibly overwriting older versions of the same templates).

ADVENTURE - COMMAND BLOCKS:
There may be monsters, there may be traps, there may be treasure, there may be custom-trade villagers, and most assuredly there are going to be lots of Command Blocks.

If you use this on a multiplayer server, be sure to enable command blocks in the system properties.

Special Thanks to:

* Syndaryl for bug fixes.

* Kujaku10 for additional templates!

* A1c3e5 for explaining the "/setblock ~ ~ ~ {}" trick for getting data for teBlock rules (such as flower pots).

* ... and especially to AtomicStryker for maintaining and improving my favorite Minecraft mod!  :)

Usage notes for Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's templates:

If you have a Minecraft modpack including AtomicStryker's Ruins, you are WELCOME to use any or all of our (Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's) templates, and to modify them to best fit your setup.  Please feel free to copy parts of these structures, to borrow ideas for custom mobs, traps, and so forth.  Some of these templates are specifically intended as "proof-of-concept" to share ideas with other Ruins builders.

If you do include these in a modpack, I'd love to hear about it on the Ruins forum thread or via PM.  :)
