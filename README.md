This is my personal Mod pack

To use you will need Minecraft 1.10.2 and [Mineforge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.10.2.html#Downloads) 
If you need help installing Mineforge you can use [this site](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Minecraft-Forge). 

To get Minecraft you can click [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Download-Minecraft).

There are two Resource Packs includes with this pack, I recommend using them. They can both be found [here](https://mods.curse.com/texture-packs/minecraft/equanimity-32x) and [here](http://f32.me/) if you wish to check them out.

I also use an in game wiki system (More info about that to come).

You can connect to my server using the address: **96.47.66.139**  You need permission to do much of anything on the server.
