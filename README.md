- A Quick update as well that minecraft forge install video forgets to tell you that you need to create a profile for 1.10.2 first, so go to the  Launcher Options first and then click the big Add new + Button, Select 1.10.2 as the version, Name the profile something you can remember, it does however show up in the client lists, change the settings  like your memory as you see fit, then click the save button, then follow the minecraft forge install video.

- After you install minecraft forge, go back to your profile you created and in the Version area and select release 1.10.2-forge1.10.2-xxxxxxxxx.  The X's are whatever version number that was installed.
